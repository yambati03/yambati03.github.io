			<p>Recently, I watched an <a href="https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs" target="_blank">amazing video</a> by Grant Sanderson from <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a> in which he explores how different factors affect the spread of disease using a toy SIR model.
				I suggest checking it out! After watching his video, I decided to code up my own version of the simulation to try and explore a few more things.
			</p>
			<p> In our simulation, we use proximity to determine transmission. This is the basic model: </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>When a <span class="term healthy">healthy</span> person comes within a set radius of an <span class="term infected">infected</span> person, they have a chance of also becoming infected. </li>
			  <li>Once a person becomes <span class="term infected">infected</span>, they first enter an <span class="term incubation">incubation</span> period where they show no signs or symptoms, but can still spread the disease. </li>
			  <li>They are then removed after a period of time. That is, they have a chance of becoming <span class="term recovered">recovered</span> or <span class="term deceased">deceased</span> at which point they cannot get infected or infect anyone else.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Our model, in its simplest form, looks like this: </p>
			<video autoplay muted loop width="30%" controls><source src="../assets/basicmodel.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag</video>
			<p> As you can see, our entire population gets infected very quickly. We can slow disease transmission by introducing quarantining: </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>After a person becomes <span class="term infected">infected</span>, they are moved to quarantine after 1 day where they cannot infect any <span class="term healthy">healthy</span> people </li>
			  <li>Quarantining is triggered after the population passes a threshold of <span class="term infected">infected</span> people. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> Our model, now with a quarantining response. </p>
			<video autoplay muted loop width="30%" controls><source src="../assets/basicquarantine.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag</video>
			<p> Remember, this is a "perfect" quarantining model meaning that <b>everyone</b> that contracts the disease is quarantined.
				In reality, some people never show signs or symptoms and may never be quarantined. </p>
			<p> Let's introduce another response: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" target="_blank">social distancing</a>.
				Again, we will never have "perfect" distancing. It might not be just that people are ignoring federal warnings, per se, but rather they have work, groceries, or other obligations to attend to.</p>
			<ul>
			  <li> People who are social distancing stop meandering, but can still become <span class="term infected">infected</span> and can be quarantined. </li>
			  <li> Social distancing is not perfect, so there is a fraction of the population who still keep moving around. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> The video on the left shows <b>60%</b> of the population distancing while the one on the right shows <b>80%.</b> Note the number of people who remain healthy at the end of the simulation.</p>

			<h3> It's in the air! </h3>
			<p> I came across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/14/science/coronavirus-transmission-cough-6-feet-ar-ul.html" target="_blank">this</a> article from the New York Times that investigates virus transmission
				through respiratory droplets to explain the six-feet rule— and why it doesn’t just end there. </p>
			<p>This is what caught my eye: “small droplets known as <b>aerosols can remain suspended or travel through the air</b> before they eventually settle on surfaces.”
				This means that when someone coughs or sneezes, the expelled droplets can be suspended in the air for more than <b>20 minutes</b>.
				So, does this mean that even if we maintain our six-feet rule, it may be ineffective in central hubs such as grocery stores?
				Let’s see what happens when we introduce these latent droplets to our population.</p>
			<p> Let’s introduce a central hub to our population: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each non-<span class="term deceased">deceased</span> person has a chance of travelling to the hub where they walk around for a set time and return to their original position in the environment.</li>
				<li>An <span class="term infected">infected</span> person has a chance of leaving an “infectious circle,” a proxy for suspended aerosols from coughs or sneezes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/yambati03/covid_sim" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
