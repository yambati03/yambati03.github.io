**Hi, I'm Yashas!** I'm a high-school junior at the North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics. I'm interested in AI for social good and robotics. I develop computer vision software for my robotics team, [The Zebracorns](www.team900.org) and I'm also working on a computational neuroscience project dealing with objective diagnosis for autism.
